NAME
    Test::Assert - Assertion methods for those who like JUnit.

SYNOPSIS
      package My::TestMethod;
      use base 'Test::Assert';
      sub test_method {
        my $self = shift;
        $self->assert_true(1, "pass");
        $self->assert_true(0, "fail");
      }

      package My::Test;
      use Test::Assert ':all';
      assert_true(1, "pass");
      assert_true(0, "fail");
      use Test::More;
      assert_test(sub { require_ok($module) });

      package My::Package;
      use Test::Assert 'fail';
      my $state = do_something();
      if ($state == 1) {
         # 1st state
         do_foo();
      } elsif ($state == 2) {
         # 2nd and last state
         do_bar();
      } else {
         # this shouldn't happen: assert default value
         fail("Unknown state: $state");
      }
      my $a = get_a();
      my $b = get_b();
      assert_num_not_equals(0, $b, 'Division by zero');
      my $c = $a / $b;

DESCRIPTION
    This class provides a set of assertion methods useful for writing tests.
    The API is based on JUnit4 and Test::Unit and the methods die on
    failure.

    The assertion methods can be used in class which is derived from
    Test::Assert or used as standard Perl functions after importing them
    into user's namespace.

    Test::Assert can also wrap standard Test::Simple, Test::More or other
    Test::Builder-based tests.

    The assertions can be also used for run-time checking.
